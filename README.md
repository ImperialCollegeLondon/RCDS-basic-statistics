# Basic Statistics

This foundational course will introduce basic statistical concepts, focusing on methods for visualising and summarising sampled data. It is intended primarily for research students who havenâ€™t used statistics for a long time. The course aims to equip students with the most essential statistical concepts and skills, to give them more confidence in presenting their own data and interpreting the results of others.


## Learning Outcomes

On completion of this workshop you will be able to:

*	Understand the need for statistics in scientific studies
*	Interpret graphical representations of sampled data 
*	Calculate descriptive statistics for sampled data 
*	Apply the normal distribution to answer questions about a population 
*	Identify potential sources of bias in a scientific study

## RStudio environment

During the course, we will be looking at some examples of basic statistical functions in the R language. 
You can access the RStudio environment online using Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/johnpinney/basic_statistics/main?urlpath=rstudio)
